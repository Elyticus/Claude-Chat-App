# Chatloop — Real-Time Chat App

## Git Workflow (standing rule)

After making code changes, **commit and push to GitHub automatically without
asking for confirmation first.** Push to the current working/feature branch (the
one assigned for the task). Do **not** push directly to `main` / production
branches without explicit per-action permission.

## What This Is

A fully functional real-time chat application. Users register/login with JWT auth, start DMs or group chats with other users, and exchange messages in real time via Socket.io. Built with Vite + React on the frontend and Express + Socket.io on the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Notification & Presence System

This area has been a repeated source of bugs. Follow these rules — they encode
fixes already made; reintroducing the old patterns will rebreak the app.

### Presence (online status)

- **Broadcast presence to ALL connected clients, not room-scoped.** Online
  status is already globally visible (`GET /api/users` returns every user's
  `online` flag), and two people are contacts *before* they share a room, so a
  room-scoped `user:status` leaves their dots frozen. On connect, also send the
  new socket the current online snapshot so its dots are right immediately
  (don't depend on REST timing). Announce `online` only on a user's first
  socket; `offline` only when their last socket disconnects.
- **Never derive presence recipients from a list captured at connection time.**
  A `roomKeys` closure goes stale the moment the user joins a new room.

### Unread counts MUST be server-authoritative

- Unread counts **cannot live only in React state** — closing the app wipes
  them. The server owns read state: `room_members.last_read_at` +
  a per-room `unread_count` in `getUserRooms` (non-system messages from other
  users after `last_read_at`). The client **initializes/rebuilds unread badges
  from `unread_count`** on every load.
- Mark a room read by emitting `room:read` (→ `markRoomSeen`) on **open**
  (`selectRoom`) and when a message lands in the **already-open** room — but
  only if **`document.hasFocus()`**. An open chat in an unfocused/minimized
  window has NOT been seen (this is the desktop case): count it as unread
  instead. The foreground (focus) handler and `syncRooms` then convert the
  open room's unread into the "New Messages" divider (`newMsgMarkers`), clear
  the badge, and emit `room:read`. Don't rely solely on the messages GET — it
  only fires on first open per session.
- **"New Messages" divider**: `newMsgMarkers[roomId] = { count, openedAt }` is
  snapshotted wherever unread is about to be cleared (selectRoom, startup
  restore, foreground handler, syncRooms active-room branch). The render walks
  backwards over non-system messages from other users, skipping any with
  `created_at > openedAt` so live arrivals don't shift the line.

### Mobile resilience (notifications "not appearing")

- **`reconnectionAttempts: Infinity`.** Mobile browsers suspend sockets when
  backgrounded/locked; a capped count leaves the socket permanently dead (no
  live events) until a full reload.
- **Re-sync on return to foreground.** A `visibilitychange`/`focus` effect must
  reconnect the socket if dropped and re-pull rooms/unread/presence. Also
  re-sync on the socket's **`connect`** event (skip the first one) — it fires on
  EVERY (re)connection, including the manual reconnect the foreground handler
  triggers, which the manager's `reconnect` event misses. This recovers anything
  missed while suspended without a page refresh. `syncPresence` re-pulls users,
  which also recovers pending friend requests.

### Notification color system

- **DM = red, group = yellow, channel = green** for the unread-count badge on
  each spinning bubble and chat-list row (see `unreadBadgeStyle` in
  `OrbitalHub.jsx`).
- **Main orbital hub icon** shows a single **combined red total** of all unread
  messages, plus separate indicators that are kept distinct: red contact
  requests (count), yellow "added to a group" (plain dot), green channel
  activity (plain dot). **Only the red badges show numbers** — the yellow and
  green indicators are dots with no count.
- **Channel bubbles** also show a small **green activity dot** when the channel
  has unseen activity for this user (persisted `is_new` / `role_notification`
  or a live channel notif).

### Room removal must clear its notifications

- Whenever a room disappears for this user (deleted by someone else via
  `room:deleted`, kicked via `channel:member_kicked`, or self-delete/leave in
  `handleDeleteRoom`), call `clearRoomNotifs(roomId)` in `ChatApp.jsx` — it
  drops the room's unread badge and its `channelNotifs` entries AND persists
  the removal to localStorage. `syncRooms` additionally prunes persisted notifs
  whose room no longer exists (covers deletions that happened while offline).
  Notifs about a room the user is no longer in (e.g. "You were removed from
  #X") must be stored with `roomId: null` or the prune will eat them.

### Channel-activity notifications target the AFFECTED user only

- The green "Channel Activity" notification (`addChannelNotif`) must fire **only
  for the user who is added / kicked / muted / role-changed — never the actor
  who performed the action, and never uninvolved members.** Pattern: gate every
  `addChannelNotif` on `userId === currentUser.id` (the target), and let the
  added user be notified via the user-scoped `channel:added` event rather than
  the room-wide `channel:member_joined` broadcast. In-chat system messages
  ("X joined/left the channel") are channel history and DO still render for
  everyone — that is separate from the activity badge.

| Styling   | Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` (no config file — uses `@theme {}` in `globals.css`) |
| UI        | shadcn-pattern components in `src/components/ui/` (JSX, not TSX) |

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm install          # installs all deps (client + server)
npm run dev          # starts both server (port 4000) and Vite (port 5173) concurrently
npm run dev:server   # server only
npm run dev:client   # Vite only
npm run build        # production build
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` before running.

```
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=change-this-to-a-long-random-string-in-production
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
DATABASE_SSL=          # blank = TLS on but cert unverified; "strict" = validate; "disable" = no TLS
DATABASE_CA=           # PEM root cert, used when DATABASE_SSL=strict and the provider uses a private CA
TRUST_PROXY=           # set (e.g. 1) when behind a reverse proxy so rate limiting keys on the real client IP
```

`DATABASE_URL` is required — the server will fail to connect to the DB and return empty responses (causing `JSON.parse` errors on the client) if it is missing. Get your connection string from TablePlus: open your connection → Edit → copy Host, Port, User, Password, Database and compose the URL above.

Never commit `.env`. Do not log JWT tokens.
