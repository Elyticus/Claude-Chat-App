# Chatloop — Backend

## Database Schema

Tables created automatically in `server/db.js` on first run (`initDb()`):

- **users** — `id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, last_seen`
- **rooms** — `id, name, is_group, created_at`
- **room_members** — `room_id, user_id` (pivot, PK on both; FK cascade delete)
- **messages** — `id, room_id, user_id, text, reaction, created_at` (FK cascade delete)

DM rooms have `is_group = 0` and exactly two members. Group rooms have `is_group = 1`.

**All ids are UUIDs**, generated in Node with the `uuid` package (`uuidv4()` in
every INSERT in `db.js`) — there are no SERIAL columns and the database has no
id defaults. `initDb()` runs `migrateToUuid()` first: a one-time transactional
migration that converted the original integer ids (it self-skips once
`users.id` is `uuid`). JWTs minted before the migration carry integer ids and
are rejected by `requireAuth` / the socket middleware (clients re-login).

### Creating a user directly in the database

Never insert a plain text password into `password_hash` — the login handler uses `bcrypt.compare` so the stored value must always be a bcrypt hash.

1. Generate a hash: `node scripts/generate-hash.js <password>` — copies the hash to your terminal.
2. In TablePlus, run (ids have no default — supply one with `gen_random_uuid()`):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password_hash)
   VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'username', 'email@example.com', '<paste-hash-here>');
   ```

## Socket.io Event Contract

Authentication: token is passed in the handshake `auth` object and validated before connection is accepted.

**Client → Server:**

| Event            | Payload                        | Notes                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `message:send`   | `{ roomId, text, tempId }`     | Server persists and broadcasts     |
| `message:react`  | `{ messageId, emoji }`         | Toggles — same emoji clears it     |
| `typing:start`   | `{ roomId }`                   | Broadcasts to others in room       |
| `typing:stop`    | `{ roomId }`                   | Broadcasts to others in room       |
| `room:read`      | `{ roomId }`                   | Persists read state (`markRoomSeen` → advances `last_read_at`); emit on open and on a message arriving in the open room |

**Server → Client:**

| Event               | Payload                                     | Notes                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `message:new`       | `{ roomId, message }`                       | Sent to all room members except sender   |
| `message:ack`       | `{ tempId, message, roomId }`               | Sent only to sender; replaces temp msg   |
| `message:reaction`  | `{ roomId, messageId, emoji }`              | Broadcast to all room members            |
| `message:deleted`   | `{ roomId, messageId }`                     | Broadcast to all room members            |
| `typing:update`     | `{ roomId, userId, username, typing }`      | Broadcast to others in room; also emitted with `typing:false` to every room a socket was in when it disconnects, so a "typing…" indicator never sticks after the typer drops |
| `contact:accepted`  | `{ by: { id, username } }`                  | To the requester when their friend request is accepted |
| `contact:declined`  | `{ by: { id, username } }`                  | To the requester when their friend request is declined (only a pending incoming request being deleted — not a cancel/unfriend) |
| `room:member_joined`| `{ roomId, userId, username, addedBy, systemMessage }` | Group only — broadcast to existing members when someone is added; the added user gets `room:new` instead |
| `user:status`       | `{ userId, online }`                        | **Global** broadcast on first connect / last disconnect; plus a per-user snapshot to each newly connected socket |

## Presence / Online Status

- `online` Map in `server/index.js` tracks `userId → Set<socketId>` (handles multiple tabs).
- On `connection`: user joins all their rooms; the new socket is sent the
  **current online snapshot** (one `user:status` per already-online user); then
  `user:status { online: true }` is broadcast to **all** clients — but only on
  the user's **first** socket.
- On `disconnect`: if no remaining sockets, `user:status { online: false }` is
  broadcast to **all** clients.
- **Do NOT scope presence to room-mates.** Online status is globally visible via
  `GET /api/users`, and contacts are often roomless — room-scoping (or a
  connection-time `roomKeys` closure) leaves their dots frozen. See the
  "Notification & Presence System" section in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Unread Counts

- `room_members.last_read_at` (epoch, defaults to `NOW()`) is the read marker.
  `getUserRooms` returns a per-room `unread_count` = non-system messages from
  other users with `created_at > COALESCE(last_read_at, joined_at)`.
- `markRoomSeen` advances `last_read_at` (also clears `is_new` /
  `role_notification`). It is called from the `room:read` socket event and from
  `GET /api/rooms/:id/messages`.
- Unread counts are **durable** (survive reload/app-close) — the client must
  rebuild its badges from `unread_count`, never keep them only in memory.

## Unfriending cascades to shared chats

- `DELETE /api/contacts/:contactId` removes the contact relationship **and**
  cleans up the chats the two users share: the direct **DM is deleted** for both
  (`room:deleted`), and the ex-contact is **removed from any channel where the
  remover is an owner/admin who outranks them** (reuses the channel-kick rules +
  `channel:member_kicked`). Only the other person is removed — the remover stays
  in the channels. **Plain groups have no role/ownership model**, so there is no
  authority to remove anyone and group membership is intentionally left
  untouched. If group removal is ever wanted, groups need an owner concept first.

## Backend Pitfalls

- **Socket handlers MUST be wrapped in `safe()` and validate ids with `isId()`**
  (see `server/index.js`). Socket.io does not catch rejected async handlers —
  an invalid payload (e.g. `roomId: {}`) that makes a pg query throw becomes an
  unhandled rejection and kills the process. Express 5 routes auto-forward
  rejections to the error handler; socket handlers do not. Never add a bare
  `socket.on("x", async ...)`.
- **Ids are UUID strings — never `Number()` them.** `isId()` is a UUID check
  (`uuid` package's `validate`). REST route params (`:roomId`, `:userId`,
  `:messageId`, `:contactId`, `:id`) are validated by `app.param` middleware;
  body ids and socket payload ids must be checked with `isId()` explicitly.
  On the client the same applies: compare ids with `===` as strings
  (`userBg()` hashes the string for colors).
- **`getUserById` deliberately omits `email`** — it feeds `GET /api/users/:id`,
  which any authenticated user can call. Don't add email (or other PII) back.
- **All user-supplied strings need length caps** — message text (4,000),
  username (32), group/channel name (60), description (300), reaction emoji
  (16), password (128). The JSON body limit (512 KB) alone is not a defense.

- **JWT stored in `localStorage`** — acceptable for a learning project. For production, use httpOnly cookies + refresh token rotation.
- **Vite proxy** — `/api` and `/socket.io` are proxied to `localhost:4000` in dev only. In production, serve the Vite build from Express directly.
- **Avatar broadcast scope** — `user:avatar` must be scoped to the user's rooms with `io.to(roomKeys).emit(...)`, never `io.emit(...)` (would broadcast to all connected clients).
- **Group size limit** — `POST /api/rooms/group` enforces a 50-member cap. Never remove this guard.
- **`typing:stop` membership check** — always verify `isMember` before broadcasting typing events, just as `typing:start` does. An unverified stop event would let any socket silence another user's typing indicator.

- **`message:send` is rate-limited per socket** — a token bucket (`createTokenBucket`, ~5/sec sustained, burst 10) lives in the connection closure and gates `message:send`. It's the only thing stopping a client from flooding the DB with writes; the length cap and JSON body limit don't bound message *frequency*. Don't remove it, and key any similar high-write socket events the same way.

- **Login runs bcrypt even when the email is unknown** — `/api/auth/login` compares against `DUMMY_PASSWORD_HASH` when no user row is found, so response time is uniform and can't be used to enumerate registered emails. Never short-circuit before the compare.

- **DB TLS is configurable, not hard-disabled** — `buildSsl()` in `db.js` honours `DATABASE_SSL` (`strict`/`disable`) and `DATABASE_CA`. Keep the default backward-compatible, but production should run `DATABASE_SSL=strict`. Don't revert to an unconditional `rejectUnauthorized: false`.

- **Expired auth rows are swept** — `purgeExpiredAuthRows()` (startup + hourly) drops expired `pending_verifications` / `password_reset_tokens` so password hashes and codes don't linger. The on-access deletes in the handlers are still required; the sweep only covers abandoned flows.
